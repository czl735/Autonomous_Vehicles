Autonomous_Vehicles_withMITCarla_

## Description

1. Integrate vehicle modeling and controller design into a complete vehicle control system
2. Develop a working simulation with a python-based vehicle autonomy agent
3. Tune a control system for tracking performance on a complex path

## Tools
CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator
* CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can
be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. 

## Part 1: PID controller
